In May of 2021, I was selected for Google Summer of Code'21 to work with [Sugar Labs](https://github.com/sugarlabs/). My project goals were to improve security and availabilty of [Sugarizer](https://github.com/llaske/sugarizer) and other projects affiliated with it namely: 
* [Sugarizer-School-Portal-Server](https://github.com/NikhilM98/sugarizer-school-portal-server), 
* [Sugarizer-Chart](https://github.com/NikhilM98/sugarizer-chart), 
* [Sugarizer-School-Portal-Chart](https://github.com/NikhilM98/sugarizer-school-portal-chart) and 
* [Sugarizer-Server](https://github.com/llaske/sugarizer-server)

## üìô Abstract

[Sugarizer](https://sugarizer.org/) is a free/libre learning platform. The Sugarizer UI use ergonomic principles from The [Sugar platform](https://sugarlabs.org/), developed for the One Laptop per Child project and used by more than 2 million children around the world.

Sugarizer runs on every device: laptops, desktops, tiny computers, tablets or smartphones.

Sugarizer includes a large set of pedagogic activities thought for children, see [here](https://sugarizer.org/activities.html) for a full list.

Sugarizer is available as:

* Application: an installable app for every operating system
* Web Application: a web application that runs in modern web browsers

**Thanks to former GSoC Projects, Sugarizer can easily be deployed on Kubernetes clusters to meet some users deployment expectations.**
**The objective of this project is to keep Sugarizer growing by enhancing two core concepts for our deployments: Security and Availability.**
